# 🚀 Andre Dickson — Principal Engineer / Founder @ Dexios Software  

I’m a Pittsburgh-based engineer with **18+ years** building web platforms that blend **elegant front-end design** with **industrial-strength back-end architecture**.  

💡 **Currently building:** [Project RedFrost](https://github.com/adickson311) — a modern SaaS platform, powered by **Angular 21**, **NestJS**, and **TypeORM**.  

🧠 **Tech stack passions:**  
TypeScript • Angular • NestJS • Node.js • RxJS • PostgreSQL • Docker • OpenShift • CI/CD  

🤝 **Collaboration goals:**  
I’m always open to connecting with developers who care about **clean architecture**, **composable UIs**, and **real-world engineering ethics** — not hype.
